# Project Description

<!-- Add a short paragraph describing the project. -->

"[Imaging

## Objective

<!-- Describe here WHAT you would like to achieve (what you will have as end result). -->

"1.  Leverage IDC data for SOTA segmentation algorithm(nnUNet, MONAI)
2.  Collaborate with other members to study the feasibility of using IDC data for training AI algorithms."

## Approach and Plan

<!-- Describe here HOW you would like to achieve the objectives stated above. -->

"1.  Using nnUNet segmentation framework for prostate segmentation on IDC data([Prostatex/QIN collection](https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/explore/filters/?collection_id=Community\&collection_id=QIN\&collection_id=prostate_mri_us_biopsy\&collection_id=prostatex\&collection_id=qin_prostate_repeatability)) for training purposes.
2.  Expand AI training use cases beyond SOTA algorithms."

## Progress and Next Steps

<!-- Update this section as you make progress, describing of what you have ACTUALLY DONE.
     If there are specific steps that you could not complete then you can describe them here, too. -->
